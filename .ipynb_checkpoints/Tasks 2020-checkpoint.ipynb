    "The square roots of numbers that are not a perfect square are irrational numbers meaning they cannot be written as the quotient of two integers.

    " A rational number is a number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q. Since q may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number.  2 is therefore a rational number (2/1).  For √2 to be rational, it must be expressed in the form a/b, where a and b are whole numbers as √2 = a/b.\n",
