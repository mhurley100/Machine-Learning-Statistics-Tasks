# Machine-Learning-Statistics-Tasks 2020 

## Maura Hurley

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with the solutions to the Tasks for Machine Learning & Statistics 2020.  
There are 4 tasks:


## Task 1:  Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places

Research if it is possible to calculate with precision the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places without using any built in libraries.

Run python programs to determine if it is possible to calculate to 100 decimal places without using libraries

#### Task objectives:

- Research the square root of 2
- Investigate floating point numbers
- Adopt an iterative approach
- Python implementation

## Task 2:  Use scipy.stats to verify categorical data Chi squared value and calcuate the associated p value 

Pearson’s chi-squared statistical hypothesis is a test for independence between categorical variables. It is appropriate when working with categorical data. It establishes if there a pattern to the observed frequencies or if they are they purely by chance. Chi square assumes that the data is random, categories are mutually exclusive, the data is in the form of frequency or counts and that observations are independent.Run python programs to verify chi squared value and asociated p value.

#### Task objectives:

- Research the Chi-squared test
- Use Scipy.stats to verify the dataset
- Analyse the result

## Task 3:
Research the excel functions (STDDEV.P and STDDEV.S) noting the differences between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. 

#### Task objectives:
- Research STDEV.P and STDEV.S
- STDEV.P and STDEV.S differences
- Simulate using Numpy demonstrating STDEV.S is the better option for a population when performed on a sample
- Analyse the result

## Task 4:

Use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisher’s famous Iris data set. You will easily obtain a copy of the data set on-line. Explain in a Markdown cell how your code works and how accurate it might be, and then explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species of iris.

#### Task objectives:
- Research the Iris Dataset
- Use scikit learn to explain k-means clustering to the Iris data set
- Explain how model can make predictions
