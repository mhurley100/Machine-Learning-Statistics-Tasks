This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with the solutions to the Tasks for Machine Learning & Statistics 2020.  
There are 4 tasks:


## Task 1:  Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places

Research if it is possible to calculate with precision the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places without using any built in libraries.

Run python programs to determine if it is possible to calculate to 100 decimal places without using libraries


## Task 2:  Use scipy.stats to verify categorical data Chi squared value and calcuate the associated p value 

Pearsonâ€™s chi-squared statistical hypothesis is a test for independence between categorical variables. It is appropriate when working with categorical data. It establishes if there a pattern to the observed frequencies or if they are they purely by chance. Chi square assumes that the data is random, categories are mutually exclusive, the data is in the form of frequency or counts and that observations are independent.Run python programs to verify chi squared value and asociated p value.


## Task 3:
Research the excel functions (STDDEV.P and STDDEV.S) noting the differences between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. 


## Task 4:
