# Machine-Learning-Statistics-Tasks 2020 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with the solutions to the Tasks for Machine Learning & Statistics 2020


## Task 1:  Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places

#### Project Plan:
Research the square root of 2.  It is an even number that is irrational.
Research floating point precision and rounding errors in computer science
Look at Newtons method

Analysis
Run python programs to determine if it is possible to calculate to 100 decimal places without using libraries
