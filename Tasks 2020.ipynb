    "One way of computing square roots is Newton’s method. Suppose that you want to know the square root of n. If you start with almost any approximation, you can compute a better approximation with the following formula:\n",

    "In general, Newton’s algorithm will eventually reach a point where the new approximation is no better than the previous. At that point, we could simply stop. In other words, by repeatedly applying this formula until the better approximation gets close enough to the previous one, we can write a function for computing the square root that uses the number of iterations necessary and no more.\n",

Each time through the loop we compute a “better” approximation using the formula described earlier. As long as the “better” is different, we try again. Step through the program and watch the approximations get closer and closer.\n",
